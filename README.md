# Number-Tax-Generator
## Generates a number based on a tax of a float, e.g 100 * 1.2 (120%)

How it works (in detail):<br />
When you run the program, you need to specify 2 arguments in the command, e.g "python3 tax.py 123 1.2", and it'll come out something like "With tax of 1.2, 123 will turn into 147.6."<br />
123, being the value you're taxing, and 1.2 being the "tax value". I recommend not making the tax higher than 2 and the value higher than the 32-bit integer limit.
